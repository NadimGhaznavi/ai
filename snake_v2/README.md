## Introduction and Scope

This project is the AI Snake Game. It consists of the old classic video *Snake Game*
where the snake is controlled by the arrow keys. The goal is to navigate so that
the snake *eats* the food. Each time the snake eats food it grows one segment.
The game ends when the snake either hits the edge of the game screen or hits 
itself.

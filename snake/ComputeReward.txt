def compute_reward(snake, food, action):
    if snake.has_collided():
        return -10
    elif snake.has_eaten_food():
        return +10
    else:
        # Distance-based reward
        old_distance = euclidean_distance(snake.prev_head, food)
        new_distance = euclidean_distance(snake.head, food)

        if new_distance < old_distance:
            return +0.1  # Encourages moving toward food
        else:
            return -0.1  # Discourages moving away

    return 0


This should help it learn basic navigation. Later, you can experiment with shaping the rewards further, like:

Encouraging longer survival (small reward per timestep)
Penalizing unnecessary movement (to avoid looping in place)
Increasing reward for eating food as the game progresses (to prevent stalling behavior)
